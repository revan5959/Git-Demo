Git-Demo

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

USAGE

To run you will need a story file, and a log4perl configuration.
By default the application (git-demo) will look for a configuration file in 
~/.git-demo/config.yaml
and a log4perl configuration
~/.git-demo/log4perl.conf

There are examples of all in the samples directory

Usage without a .git-demo directory in your home:
git-demo --log4perl /path/to/my/log4perl.conf --story_file /path/to/my/story.yaml

Usage with a .git-demo directory in your home:
git-demo

FAQ

File::Temp is used to create a temporary directory to work in.  In this directory a
sub directory is created for each character, and a git repository initialised there.

In the current form, each character has just one repository, and it is assumed that
all the characters are working on the same project.

It is possible to run multiple Git::Demo instanses simultaneously - each one will
create its own temporary directory to work in.

To create a bare repository, create a character like this:

  characters:
  - name: origin
    git_args:
    - --bare

This is also a good way to simulate a central repository from which the other characters
can synchronise and collaborate in.
